# Advent of Code Solutions

This is a repository where I solve the programming challenges from the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event. I use this repository to challenge myself and learn new programming languages. Currently, I solve the challenges in JavaScript, Python, and Elixir. This repository contains my solutions for each challenge that I've solved, organized by year and day. 

I am now interested in learning [Go](https://golang.org/) with this approach. 

Happy coding!
